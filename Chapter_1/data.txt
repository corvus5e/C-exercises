Varoufakis was born in Palaio Faliro, Athens, on 24 March 1961, to Georgios and Eleni Varoufakis.[4]

Varoufakis's father, Georgios Varoufakis, was an Egyptiote Greek (but ultimately originating from Rethymno in Crete) who emigrated from Cairo to Greece in the 1940s, arriving in the midst of the Greek Civil War. One day, he was "roughed up" by the police and asked to sign a denunciation of communism. In response, he said: "Look I am not a Buddhist, but I would never sign a denunciation of Buddhism".[5] He therefore ended up spending several years imprisoned on the island of Makronisos, which was used for the political re-education of people who fought on the communist side in the war.[6] After being released in 1950, he completed his university studies and found employment as the personal assistant to the owner of Halyvourgiki; Greece's biggest steel producer.[6][7] In 2003, he was appointed chairman of the board of directors of "Halyvourgiki"; a position he held until the company closed in January 2020.[8] He died in September 2021.[8]

Varoufakis's mother, a student at the University of Athens School of Chemistry at the time she met Georgios, abandoned her conservative background[4] after meeting her husband who was, at the time, allied to United Democratic Left (EDA). In the mid-1970s Eleni Varoufaki became an activist for the Women's Union of Greece, which promoted gender equality and had been set up by members of PASOK.[6] By the early-1980s, the couple had converged politically to the same political centre-left views and engaged with the socialist PASOK.[4] Eleni was elected Deputy Mayor of Palaio Faliro a few years before she died in 2008.[citation needed]

Varoufakis was six years old when the military coup d'Ã©tat of April 1967 took place. Varoufakis later said that the military junta showed him a "sense of what it means to be both unfree and, at once, convinced that the possibilities for progress and improvement are endless". The junta collapsed when Varoufakis was in junior high school.[9] Attending the private Moraitis School, Varoufakis decided early to spell his first name with one nu, rather than the standard two, for "aesthetic" reasons. When his teacher gave him a low mark for that, he became angry and has continued spelling his first name with one nu ever since.[10]

Varoufakis finished his secondary education around 1976, when his parents deemed it too dangerous for him to continue his education in Greece. Therefore, he moved to the United Kingdom in 1978 where he entered the University of Essex. His "initial urge was to study physics" but he decided that "the lingua franca of political discourse was economics". He therefore enrolled in the economics course at Essex, but it has also been suggested that he decided to enroll in economics after meeting Andreas Papandreou.[6] After only a few weeks of lectures, Varoufakis switched his degree to mathematics.[9] Whilst at the University of Essex he joined a variety of political organisations including ComSoc (the University Communist Society) and the Troops Out Movement, which campaigned for a British withdrawal from Northern Ireland. He also became involved with the African National Congress, Palestine Liberation Organization, and other organisations such as those in solidarity with Chile. Varoufakis was also elected as secretary of the Black Students Alliance, a choice that caused some controversy, given that he is not black, to which he responded by telling them, according to his PhD supervisor Monojit Chatterji, "that black was a political term and, as a Greek, on the grounds of ethnicity he had as much reason to be there as anyone else."[7] Varoufakis also took part in student debates, where one of his rivals was John Bercow, who later became the Speaker of the House of Commons.[7]

He moved to the University of Birmingham in October 1981, obtaining an MSc in mathematical statistics in October 1982. He completed his PhD in economics in 1987 writing a thesis on Optimization and Strikes, back at the University of Essex, where his PhD supervisor was Monojit Chatterji.[11]
