    Gangster: [on a video playing on a TV in another room] You was here last night too, wasn't ya?
    Concierge: [hesitates and unaware he's listening to a video] ... Yes, sir. I was.
    [nods]
    Gangster: [sternly] You was here, and you was smoochin' with my brother!
    [the Concierge assumes that the gangster was referring to the embarrassing incident that happened last night but denies it]
    Concierge: [scoffs, grins in embarrassment and half laughs] I'm-I'm afraid you're mistaken, sir.
    Gangster: Don't gimme that! You've been smoochin' with everybody! Snuffy, Al, Leo, Little Moe with the gimpy leg, Cheeks, Boney Bob, Cliff.
    [the Concierge is shocked and confused by this accusation. Coincidentally, one of the other staff members happens to be called Cliff, it says so on his name badge. He gasps and the others look at him in disbelief, shocked]
    Cliff: [looks alarmed and panics] No... it's a lie!
    Gangster: I could go on forever, baby!
    Concierge: [half laughing] I'm terribly sorry, sir, but I'm afraid you're mistaken. We're looking for a young man.
    Gangster Johnny on TV: Maybe I'm off my hinges, but I believe ya. That's why I'm gonna let ya go. I'm gonna give you to the count of three to get your lousy, lyin', low-down, four-flushing carcass OUT my door! 1... 2...
    [Fires Tommy gun, killing girl gangster, and laughing insanely]
    Gangster Johnny on TV: 3. Merry Christmas, you filthy animal.
    [fires repeatedly again]
    Gangster Johnny on TV: And a Happy New Year.
    [Fires one last shot]
